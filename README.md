## Description

This application is a book search engine using Google's book search engine API built in MERN stack. This assignment was originally built with RESTful API's and we had to refactor it to work with GraphQL and MERN.

## Installation

First you must clone the repository to your device and then run npm install to add all dependencies required. After installing all dependencies you must have MongoDB installed to sync the database.

## Usage

After installation and starting the server by running 'npm run develop' in the command line, the user is taken to the applications homepage where they can search for books. Saving books to a profile is only available to users who are logged in. Users who are not logged in will not be able to save books.
